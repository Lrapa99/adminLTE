What is Cignadlte
###################

Cignadlte is combining CodeIgniter 3, a renowned PHP framework, with AdminLTE 3.2.0. This integration streamlines the development process, enabling developers to create sophisticated web applications that not only boast a powerful backend but also offer an intuitive and visually appealing administrative interface for efficient management and control.

*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
