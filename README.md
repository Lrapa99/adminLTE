## What is Cignadlte

Cignadlte is combining CodeIgniter 3, a renowned PHP framework, with AdminLTE 3.2.0. This integration streamlines the development process, enabling developers to create sophisticated web applications that not only boast a powerful backend but also offer an intuitive and visually appealing administrative interface for efficient management and control.

## Server Requirements

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.

## Installations

- Rename `.env-test` in `applications` folder to `.env`, and populate the data according to your database config.
- In cli/bash run `composer install` it will install dependency from `composer.json`.
- That's it. You are good to go, open your browser and go to <http://localhost/cignadlte>.
- Have fun.
